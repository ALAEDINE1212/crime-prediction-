Crime Prediction Using Machine Learning (West Yorkshire)
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the group project work for the Discipline-Specific Artificial Intelligence Project (COS-5031-E) at the University of Bradford.

The project focuses on building a machine learning prototype that analyses West Yorkshire crime data (2018 – January 2024) to identify patterns, correlations, and crime hotspots, and to predict where and when crimes are most likely to occur.

The solution is developed as part of a simulated 9-month internship at Future AI for ALL (FALL), where team members take on professional roles such as Associate AI Engineer, Scrum Master, and Product Owner.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyse large-scale real-world crime data (1M+ records)

Identify relationships between:

Crime type

Location

Time (month/year)

Crime outcomes

Build a predictive machine learning model

Produce visual insights such as crime heatmaps

Follow Agile project management with documented risks, planning, and sprints

Ensure ethical and responsible AI considerations
